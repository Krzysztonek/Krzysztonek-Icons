<h1>My HA Icons</h1>

This is my own repository, which includes some individual icons I use in Home Assistant. It wasn't be possible without the amazing work from:
<li>[Custom Brand Icons](https://github.com/elax46/custom-brand-icons) by @elax46</li>
<li>[Homeassistant Custom Icons](https://github.com/mathoudebine/homeassistant-custom-icons) by @mathoudebine</li>

PNGs must be converted to SVGs respectively before use.

How to create your own icon? Look here: https://github.com/mathoudebine/homeassistant-custom-icons
